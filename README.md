# project1
The first group project for Data Analytics Class

Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This helps provide direction and prevent scope creep.
Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including:

The kind of data you'd like to work with/field you're interested in (e.g., geodata, weather data, etc.)

The kinds of questions you'll be asking of that data

Possible source for such data

In other words, write down what kind of data you plan to work with, and what kinds of questions you'd like to ask of it. This constitutes your Project Proposal/Outline, and should look something like this:

Our project is to uncover patterns in criminal activity around Los Angeles. We'll examine relationships between types of crime and location; crime rates and times of day; trends in crime rates over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.
